# Code Call Outs

## Code Call Out 3.1 - Propensity Score Matching and Job Training Programs

In observational studies, where treatment assignment is not random, estimating causal effects can be challenging due to potential confounding factors. One method to address this challenge is Propensity Score Matching (PSM) which assumes *selection on observables*. PSM aims to control for observed confounding by matching treated units with untreated units that have similar propensity scores. The propensity score for a unit is the probability of receiving the treatment given observed covariates. By matching on propensity scores, we aim to create a scenario where the distribution of observed covariates is similar between the treated and untreated groups, mimicking a randomized experiment. This method allows to estimate causal treatment effects in observational settings, making it a valuable tool in microeconometrics.

In this example, we will consider a setting studied by @Lalonde1986 and @DeheijaWahba2002, @DeheijaWahba1999.  There, the authors sought to compare an estimate based on observational methods with an experimental programme evaluation, to see how well observational methods compare to experimental estimates. The original experimental estimates suggested that the receipt of a job training program increased earnings by $1,794 using this estimation sample.   In this code call out, we work with data provided by @DeheijaWahba1999 which consists of an experimentally treated samples, as well as a similar sample of untreated units drawn from a large survey database (the CPS and PSID).  The dataset contains information on individuals' participation in the program (treat), their earnings in 1978 (re78) which follows program participation (in the case of treated observations), and several other covariates such as age, education, race, marital status, and earnings in 1974 and 1975 (pre-treatment outcomes). Our main objective in this exercise is to estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) of the job training program on earnings in 1978 using Propensity Score Matching.

# Load the dataset

## Code Call Out 3.2 - Considering Overlap and Variable Balance
Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been a subject of extensive study due to its potential impact on infant health outcomes, such as birth weight. However, simply comparing the birth weights of infants born to smokers versus non-smokers may not account for confounding factors that influence both the likelihood of smoking and birth outcomes.  In this code call out, we will work with data from @Almondetal2005 which consists of a child's birthweight, an indicator of whether their mother smoked during pregnancy, and a number of covariates.

```{python}

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

```
```{python}
# Read in data
birth_weight = pd.read_csv("Datasets/Birth_Weight.csv")

# Recod variables in binary
birth_weight['mmarried'] = birth_weight['mmarried'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Married" else 0)
birth_weight['fbaby'] = birth_weight['fbaby'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Yes" else 0)
birth_weight['mbsmoke'] = birth_weight['mbsmoke'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Smoker" else 0)

# Consider an OLS regression conditioning on covariates
ols_model = smf.ols('bweight ~ mbsmoke + mmarried + mage + medu + fbaby', data=birth_weight).fit()
print(ols_model.summary())

# Estimate propensity score
X = birth_weight[['mmarried', 'mage', 'medu', 'fbaby']]
y = birth_weight['mbsmoke']
logit = LogisticRegression()
logit.fit(X, y)
birth_weight['pscore'] = logit.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]

# Examine overlap
sns.kdeplot(birth_weight[birth_weight['mbsmoke'] == 0]['pscore'], shade=True, label='No Smoker')
sns.kdeplot(birth_weight[birth_weight['mbsmoke'] == 1]['pscore'], shade=True, label='Smoker')
plt.xlabel('Propensity Score')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.show()

# Conduct nearest-neighbour matching
smokers = birth_weight[birth_weight['mbsmoke'] == 1]
non_smokers = birth_weight[birth_weight['mbsmoke'] == 0]
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
nn.fit(non_smokers[['pscore']])
matches = nn.kneighbors(smokers[['pscore']], return_distance=False)
matched_smokers = smokers
matched_non_smokers = non_smokers.iloc[matches[:, 0]]

# Comare matched groups
matched_data = pd.concat([matched_smokers, matched_non_smokers])
matched_data.boxplot(column='bweight', by='mbsmoke')
plt.xlabel('Mother Smoked')
plt.ylabel('Birth Weight')
plt.show()
